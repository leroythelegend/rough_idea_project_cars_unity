# rough_idea_project_cars_unity

I have no idea how to use Unity so this is just a repo with some project cars packet capturing code that compiles in Unity.

test.cs has my first attempt at getting something to work.

No guaranty any of this is going to work, however you can clone or download the code and get something going yourself see my csharp
repo on how the code works.
