# rough_idea_project_cars_unity

I have no idea how to use Unity so this is just a repo with some project cars packet capturing code that compiles in Unity.

NOTE create a Tracks dir in Assets because TelemetrySaveTrack.cs saves the track info to ./Tracks/

test.cs has my first attempt at getting something to work.

No guaranty any of this is going to work, however you can clone or download the code and get something going yourself see my csharp
repo on how the code works. (I have updated the states which is different from the link below)
